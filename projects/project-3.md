The Manoa Jam application allows students to login and create a profile indicating their musical tastes, their musical capabilities, and their musical goals (from occasional, informal jam sessions to performing bands). The profile can also include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks with examples of their musicianship.

We built the website using Semantic UI and Meteor, and managed work and code through GitHub.
I primarily involved myself with the logo, graphics, ui and the management of GitHub issues. Through this project, I learned how to use GitHub as a project and Team Management tool, not just a repository of version controlled files.
