I hate semicolons. It seems like I always forget to put in. It’s one of the reasons I love using Python. Besides this small annoyance, Javascript was easy enough to learn; its designed to be very much like other object oriented programming languages I’ve learned.

I’ve seen and used JSON a bit in the past, but I’ve never been formally taught how to use it with Javascript. After doing Code Camp, I have a much better understanding how it is formatted and why it’s formatted the way it is. From a software engineering perspective, Javascript seems like a very useful language.

I’m a bit on the fence when it comes to athletic software engineering. On one hand, it’s good to have many examples and exercises to complete, while on the other hand, the time constraints don’t exactly allow for any mistakes to be made, especially the kinds that cause Javascript to crash.
